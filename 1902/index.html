                A specific, yet unique book in 1902 was published in various different editions. Many of which had a different book color, a different woman's image on the front cover, and some even had the illustrator's name printed on them. Is digitization destroying what was once considered an unique aspect of our printing history? Let's find out.

            The covers can be freely dragged around and placed right on top of the naked book. Each of the cover represents one of the cover editions available of <em>An Old Sweetheart Of Mine</em> from 1902.

            My creative work was a website I built up from scratch, inspired by Andrew Stauffer’s “On Digitization and the Future of the Print Record.” My idea originated from Andrew Stauffer’s concept of comparing book editions of An Old Sweetheart of Mine written by James Whitcomb Riley and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy from 1902. This website contains an interactive game section meant to immerse the user with Andrew Stauffer’s point, that is digitization is “enabling a flattening of the human record in all of its variability and the humanities suffer thereby.” (220) With the advancement of technology, people tend to neglect the origins of the texts we read online. Before digitization, books were published in various copy editions and illustrations. The variability showed amongst all the editions is what refines the details of each book in their unique way. Through digitization of non-rare, out-of-copyright books, it is simply uploading one single catalog entry and stripping away all other copies; as if they are not equally important in terms of historical value. </p>

            This creative piece works through dragging any of the three available edition covers from An Old Sweetheart of Mine from the left column to the actual book on the right. I selectively picked out three covers out of all the published editions based on the most noticeable differences amongst them all. The first obvious contrast between them is the color choice. All of which were written by the same writer, James Whitcomb Riley, with the same illustrator, Howard Chandler Christy, in the same year of 1902. However, there exists multiple different color backgrounds for the same book. Additionally, the self-portrait in the center of the book is also something a person cannot easily overlook. They all appear in different shades. These small, yet noticeable variations are essentially the left-over evidence of our once existed fork-printing history. The concept of this interactive game is to show the importance of retaining historical values, rather than cutting down to its core in its simplest form digitally. </p>

            This creative piece of website took a while to be constructed. Along the road, I encountered many obstacles. Even though I am not fully satisfied with my final set-up, but I am more than happy I got this opportunity to step out of my comfort zone for once. The process started off with the artworks. I recreated the chosen three pieces in my own art style, and it represented all my hard work, much similar to Howard Chandler Christy’s pieces from 1902. After finishing up my pieces, I had to construct a website specifically to suit the format of the game and the book. I had to consider various colour combinations for the website to fit in with my game and I came to the conclusion that golden fonts and navy-blue background color is ultimately the best choice. Majority of the book editions had a golden color as their title and the book cover usually contained some sorts of blue in it. This is what inspired me to pick those two specific colours for the website. I think if I had more time to work on this, I would be able to add in more book selections and also more details to the website.
